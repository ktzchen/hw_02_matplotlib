For this assignment, I was interested in plotting different measurements of economic development. As an economics and international relations student, I am interested in evaluating different metrics of economic development and studying what aspects of development they can accurately capture.

## Days to Open a Business

I wanted to assess the accuracy of "days required to start business" as a measure of economic development. I tried to choose 6 countries in various stages of development from around the globe. The [data](http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?d=WDI&f=Indicator_Code%3aIC.REG.DURS) is collected from 2018. The following countries are in order of least to most days it takes to open a business: DRC, Germany, China, Bangladesh, Philippines, then Venezuela. The bar graph very obviously shows that Venezeula (230 days) is an outlier in this dataset, which I think is an accurate reflection of its current economic state. What is interesting to note is DRC's placement, which boasts a proud 7 days, lower than both China (8.5 days) and Germany (8 days), both of which are significantly more economically developed than the DRC. I think this is because the main inhibitors of economic development stem from the Second Congo War, and as a result is mainly poses infrastructural problems like access to electricity rather than administrative red tape. 

## PPP per Capita: Singapore vs. US

I am interested in economic development in postcolonial countries, and I think Singapore is specifically an interesting case study. Singapore is one of the four "Asian Tigers", which are countries in Asia that experienced rapid economic growth
